# Music Releases
9th week's project. First time on React/Vite. Spotify's API. 

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server



### The Problem

It was really challenging: new tools, new components, I had a lot of technical issues on npm and the server... but I get it! 
React is challenging but its also the base to build amazing sites! 
I find JSX a little difficult to cope but, with a little more time, I will get use to it, for sure!
